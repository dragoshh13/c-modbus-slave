 * @brief Modbus Application Data Unit (TCP/IP) - MBAP header wrapper around PDU
 * @author Jonas Almås
 *
 * @details This module provides TCP/IP specific Modbus Application Data Unit handling.
 * It wraps the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) with the Modbus Application Protocol
 * (MBAP) header for use in Modbus TCP/IP communications.
 *
 * @see mbpdu.h for the underlying PDU implementation

/**
 * @brief Handle Modbus TCP/IP ADU request
 *
 * Processes a complete Modbus Application Data Unit for TCP/IP communication.
 * Validates the MBAP (Modbus Application Protocol) header, extracts the PDU,
 * processes the request, and generates a properly formatted response with MBAP header.
 *
 * @param inst Pointer to the Modbus instance containing coil/register maps and configuration
 * @param req Pointer to received ADU data (MBAP header + PDU)
 * @param req_len Size of received ADU data in bytes (expected between MBAP_SIZE+1 and MBADU_TCP_SIZE_MAX)
 * @param res Pointer to response buffer (must be at least MBADU_TCP_SIZE_MAX bytes)
 *
 * @return Size of response data in bytes, or 0 if no response should be sent
 *
 * @note TCP ADU format: [transaction_id(2)][protocol_id(2)][length(2)][unit_id(1)][function_code][pdu_data...]
 * @note MBAP protocol ID is expected to be 0 (MBADU_TCP_PROT_ID) for standard Modbus TCP
 * @note MBAP length field specifies the number of following bytes (unit_id + PDU)
 * @note MBAP unit id serves the same purpose as slave address in serial Modbus. Normally 0x00 or 0xFF for TCP/IP.
 * @note Response buffer must be allocated by caller with sufficient space (at least MBADU_TCP_SIZE_MAX)
 * @note Transaction ID and Unit ID from request are echoed back in the response
