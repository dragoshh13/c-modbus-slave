/**
 * @brief Handle Modbus ASCII ADU request
 *
 * Processes a complete Modbus Application Data Unit for ASCII serial communication.
 * Validates the ASCII frame format, checks slave address, performs LRC checking,
 * extracts and converts the ASCII-encoded PDU to binary, processes the request,
 * and generates a properly formatted ASCII response with LRC.
 *
 * @param inst Pointer to the Modbus instance containing coil/register maps and configuration
 * @param req Pointer to received ASCII ADU data ([:][slave_addr-2][PDU][lrc-2][CR/LF])
 * @param req_len Size of received ASCII ADU data in bytes (expected between MBADU_ASCII_SIZE_MIN and MBADU_ASCII_SIZE_MAX)
 * @param res Pointer to response buffer (must be at least MBADU_ASCII_SIZE_MAX bytes)
 *
 * @return Size of response data in bytes, or 0 if no response should be sent
 *
 * @note ASCII ADU format: [':'][slave_addr_hex][function_code_hex][pdu_data_hex...][lrc_hex][CR][LF]
 * @note Responds to slave_addr, broadcast address (0), and optionally address 248 if enabled
 * @note Broadcast requests (address 0) never generate responses
 * @note Returns 0 for invalid requests, LRC errors, format errors, or broadcast messages
 * @note Response buffer must be allocated by caller with sufficient space (MBADU_ASCII_SIZE_MAX)
 * @note All data except start character and CR/LF is encoded as ASCII hexadecimal pairs
